## 2. Data Skills
- Data cleaning & preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## 3. Machine Learning
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- Common algorithms (linear regression, decision trees, clustering)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## 4. Deep Learning
- Neural networks basics
- CNNs (for images)
- RNNs & LSTMs (for sequences)
- Transformers (for text & advanced AI)
- Frameworks: PyTorch or TensorFlow

## 5. AI System Design
- How to choose models
- Building data pipelines
- Handling large datasets

## 6. MLOps & Deployment
- Version control (Git)
- Model serving (FastAPI, Flask)
- Docker & Kubernetes basics
- Cloud AI services (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Model monitoring & retraining

## 7. AI Ethics & Safety
